Some ideas generated by chatGPT 

Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential: Write a Rust program that computes the LJ potential between pairs of particles in a simulation. You can use this as a basis for a simple molecular dynamics simulation.

Verlet integration: Implement the Verlet integration algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations in Rust. This algorithm is widely used in molecular dynamics and can be a good way to demonstrate your understanding of the basics of MD simulations.

NVE ensemble: Write a Rust program that simulates a system in the NVE (constant number of particles, volume, and energy) ensemble. This is a fundamental ensemble used in molecular dynamics simulations, and simulating it can demonstrate your understanding of the underlying physics.

Velocity-Verlet algorithm: Implement the velocity-Verlet algorithm in Rust, which is another popular algorithm used in molecular dynamics simulations. This algorithm is known for its numerical stability and can be a good way to demonstrate your ability to implement complex algorithms in Rust.

Periodic boundary conditions: Implement periodic boundary conditions in your molecular dynamics simulation to simulate a system with a repeating unit cell. This can be a good way to showcase your ability to handle complex data structures and algorithms in Rust.
